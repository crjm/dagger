# GraphQL API Documentation

## Context

We chose to use `spectaql` as a quick way to generate a static HTML webpage for our GraphQL API reference, because it generates documentation based on a GraphQL schema.
For generating documentation based on a schema, `spectaql` uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Microfiber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microfiber).  

In order to tailor the documentation to our needs, we have to override the current styling and data produced from the schema.
